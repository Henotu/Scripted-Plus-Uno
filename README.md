# Scripted+ Uno

This is a modified version of Scripted UNO by ITzMeek & DeJMan

Scripted+ UNO allows for a fully scripted UNO experience in Tabletop Simulator with customizable rule sets.

New Rules added:
- Jump-In (Play a card if it exactly matches the previous card played even if it isn't your turn)
- Zero Seven (0s move everyone's hand to the right. 7s make you take another players hand)

New Features:
- Random First Player
- Game Reset : Allows you to reset the game when a player wins or use !reset as the host to reset any time

Planned:
- "+4" challenge rule. When a player plays a "+4" the next player can challenge them to see if they could have played the previous color. If they could have, the player that played the "+4" draws 4 cards and the next player takes none. If they couldn't, then the next player draws 6 cards instead of 4.
